        Do not go gentle into that good night,
        <br>
        Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
        <br>
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
    </p>
    <p>
        Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
        <br>
        Because their words had forked no lightning they
        <br>
        Do not go gentle into that good night.
    </p>
    <p>
        Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
        <br>
        Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
        <br>
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
        <br>
        And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
        <br>
        Do not go gentle into that good night.
    </p>
    <p>
        Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
        <br>
        Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
        <br>
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
    </p>
    <p>
        And you, my father, there on the sad height,
        <br>
        Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
        <br>
        Do not go gentle into that good night.
        <br>
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
    </p>
